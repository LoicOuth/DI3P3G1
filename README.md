# Welcome to my IoT Platform Project on Azure

This repository presents my project aimed at creating an IoT platform on Azure. This project leverages various Azure services like IoT Hub, Stream Analytics, and more. The project is divided into different components, each in its respective folder according to its function, facilitating efficient organization and management.

## Project Folders:

- **üìÅSunrise-Backend**: This folder houses the C# backend code, architected following clean architecture principles. It's responsible for handling data processing and various other server-side operations.

- **üìÅSunrise-Mobile**: This folder contains the React Native mobile application. The application acts as the user interface for interacting with the IoT devices connected to our platform and visualizing the data generated.

- **üìÅSunrise-AzureSphere**: The Azure Sphere code, written in C, resides in this folder. This code is responsible for facilitating secure and robust communication between the IoT devices and the Azure cloud.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as a demonstration of my abilities in creating end-to-end IoT solutions, leveraging cloud-based services like Azure. It is a testament to my skills in backend and frontend development, mobile application development, as well as IoT device programming using languages like C# and C, and frameworks like React Native.
For any queries or suggestions, feel free to open an issue. I hope you find this project as exciting to explore as it was for me to develop!
